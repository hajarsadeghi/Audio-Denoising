# Audio-Denoising
In this project, I have started by training a fully connected neural network with Adam optimizer to train a model for audio denoising.
Then I have experimented with CNN-1D and CNN-2D neural networks, trained the model on the train dataset and reported the results on the test set which can be played in the HTML file.
